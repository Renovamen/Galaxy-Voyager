## Game

### Fly

Fly a spaceship to eat energy coins and avoid crashing antimatter (Based on [TheAviator](https://github.com/yakudoo/TheAviator)). Voice control is supported, the flying height of the plane will depend on your decibel level after clicking the "microphone" button (Obviously this idea is inspired by 休むな！８分音符ちゃん).

[Play it](https://renovamen.github.io/Galaxy-Voyager/views/level1.html)



### Wormhole

Fly a spaceship to past a sequence of rotating barriers and avoid crashing (Based on [missile-game](https://github.com/bwhmather/missile-game)). VR is supported if you have a Google Cardboard or other similar devices. According to my test (iPhone 7 & Essential Phone), VR experience on Firefox is the best.
